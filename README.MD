## üîç Sample Code Snippets

Here are a few examples of concepts covered throughout the course:

### üìà Basic Plotting
```R
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- x^2
plot(x, y, type = "o", col = "blue", main = "Simple Plot", xlab = "X", ylab = "Y^2")
````

---

### üßÆ Matrix Operations

```R
A <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
B <- matrix(9:1, nrow = 3)
C <- A + B
print(C)
```

---

### üß† Conditional Statements and Loops

```R
for (i in 1:5) {
  if (i %% 2 == 0) {
    print(paste(i, "is even"))
  } else {
    print(paste(i, "is odd"))
  }
}
```

---

### üìä Summary Statistics

```R
data <- c(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42)
mean(data)
median(data)
sd(data)
```

---

### üìÇ Reading CSV Files

```R
df <- read.csv("data.csv")
head(df)
```

---

### üìê Simple Linear Regression

```R
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
model <- lm(y ~ x)
summary(model)
```
